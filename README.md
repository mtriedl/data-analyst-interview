# Data Analyst Technical Test

This is the repository containing instructions and base data for a technical assessment. The purpose is to gauge your technical abilities.

## Overview

To help us evaluate your response to this test, we would prefer it if you responded using a Jupyter notebook. This allows you to annotate your response as required, and makes your response easier to evaluate.

### Python

If you haven't used Jupyter before, here's how to get yourself set up:

<https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#new-to-python-and-jupyter>

### SQL/Excel

It is possible to answer this test using Excel or SQL alone. If this is your preference, please ensure your submission is well annotated - including any intermediate steps necessary to answer each question.

## Submission

Please return your analysis and results via email to Matthew & Emily.

## The Data

The data used for this assessment is sourced from the **Museum of Modern Art data on Kaggle**: <https://www.kaggle.com/momanyc/museum-collection>

### Content

The artworks data set contains 130,262 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum. Some of these records have incomplete information and are noted as “not curator approved.” The artists dataset contains 15,091 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA's collection and have been cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, and death year.

### The Database

To make sure that this test can run on any machine, we're using SQLite: <https://www.sqlite.org/index.html>

We have provided an example Python notebook showing how to connect to, and how to query the database using SQL.

## The Assessment

We'd like you to answer the following questions, using the method of your choice (Python, SQL or Excel)

If you are comfortable in more than one, please feel free to share one or more solutions in a different language.

* Which artist in this data set lived the longest?
* Who are the top 10 artists by the number of artworks?
* Which artist is created the most artwork by total surface area?
* Did any artists have artwork acquired during their lifetime?
* Please review the quality of the data and present any issues

## The submission

Your response should be well annotated in the chosen format. If Excel or SQL are used, be sure to provide both the response and demonstrated workings to each question.

### Good luck!
